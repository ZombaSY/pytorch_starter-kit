# Pytorch Start-kit Project
There are enormous pytorch environments in research and projects. <br/>
To minimize your efforts on setting own scripts, this repository introduces the skeletons for pytorch-beginners. <br/>
Now version is only supported for Image Segmentation and Image Classification.


## Dataset
The dataset recommend following hierarchy

```
[root_path]
â”œâ”€â”€ [train]
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ [input]
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ [label]
â””â”€â”€ [val]
    â”œâ”€â”€ [input]
    â””â”€â”€ [label]
```

## ðŸš…ðŸš… To train

If you have installed 'WandB', login your ID in command line.<br>
If not, update 'wandb: false,' in the "./configs/train_***.yml"

For <b>Segmentation</b>, update the "configs/train_segmentation.yml", "bash_train_segmentation.sh" and execute command
```
bash bash_train_segmentation.sh
```

For <b>Classification</b>, update the "configs/train_classification.yml", "bash_train_classification.sh" and execute command
```
bash bash_train_classification.sh
```


## ðŸš“ðŸš“ To inference

For <b>Inference</b>, fix the 'configs/inference.yml' and execute below command
```
bash bash_inference.sh
```


## ðŸ’•ðŸ’• Customizing your scripts!
- To update hyper-parameters, adding your [variable] in ".yml" will automatically add your variables to "self.args.[variable]"
